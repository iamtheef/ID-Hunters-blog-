# ID-Hunters-blog-

A basic blog setup which allows users to find underground music ids (title/artist) asking other users that may know a specific id.

The blog is created with mongodb , nodejs , express for the back end and html/css templates for the front end.
Each user has the following actions in their desposal :

* Register
* Login/Logout
* Comment (edit/delete)
* Make a new post (edit/delete)
* Like/Unlike other people's posts
* Watch/unwatch other people's posts
* Search records based on lastfm's open api results
* Set/Change avatar
* Change password
