The blog is created with mongodb , nodejs , express for the back end and html/css templates for the front end.
Each user has the following actions in their desposal :

register
login/logout
comment (edit/delete)
make a new post (edit/delete)
like/unlike other people's posts
watch/unwatch other people's posts
search records based on lastfm's open api results
set/change avatar
change password
